# TransportGPT - Unlocking the full potential of Singapore's urban mobility with LLMs
Develop an innovative road traffic management prototype system that harnesses Generative AI and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret, predict, and respond to dynamic road traffic conditions. The challenge involves developing and training LLMs with existing traffic data sources and communication systems to enhance traffic flow, reduce congestion, promote greener mobility options and improve overall road safety in urban environments.
